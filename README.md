Rules: Imagine you are walking stairs and playing a game with your friend. 

You throw a dice 100 times. 

If it's 1 or 2, you go one step down. 

If it's 3, 4, or 5, you go one step up. 

If you throw a 6, you have to throw the die again and walk up the resulting number of steps.

There is a 0.1% chance of falling down the stair when you make a move, basically having sto start from step 0 again. You bet your friend that you will reach up to 60 steps. 

What is the chance you will win this bet?
